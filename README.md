# MyReads Project

The focus of this project was on writing functional React code. This project is a bookshelf app that allows to select and categorize books you have read, books you are currently reading, or books you want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and uses an API server and client library.

In this application, the main page displays a list of "shelves" (i.e. categories), each of which contains a number of books. The three shelves are:

-Currently Reading  
-Want to Read  
-Read

The main page also has a link to a search page that allows you to find books to add to your library.

To run this project, you should:  
Install the dependencies using npm install and then run:  
npx create-react-app my-app  
cd my-app  
npm start

After running npm start, there will be a window that opens automatically in the browser showing the main page of the project. You can then change shelves of the books you see, or add new books using the + icon.

A starter code that demonstrates a static HTML page of the finished application, but with no interactive functionality was provided by Udacity:
